# Prodigal Task â€“ AI-Powered Knowledge Retrieval Pipeline

Welcome to the **Prodigal Task**, an end-to-end pipeline that extracts knowledge from raw documents and enables semantic search and question-answering using advanced embedding techniques and LLMs. This system transforms unstructured CSV into a powerful knowledge base you can query in natural language.

## Flowchart Overview

The system operates in **three distinct phases**:

### Phase 1 â€“ Document Processing & Embedding

Raw CSV files are:
1. Parsed into structured chunks of text.
2. Embedded using a vectorizer (e.g., Sentence Transformers).
3. Stored in a vector store (such as FAISS).

### Phase 2 â€“ Semantic Search & LLM Integration

1. User input is converted to question embeddings.
2. Embeddings are compared to the knowledge base for semantic search.
3. Top-k matching results are passed to the LLM for contextual answering.

---

### Phase 3 â€“ User Interaction

The user can:
- Ask natural language questions.
- Receive detailed, context-aware responses powered by the LLM.
